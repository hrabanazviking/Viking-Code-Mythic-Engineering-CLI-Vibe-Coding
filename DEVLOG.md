# DEVLOG — The Living Chronicle

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23
**Branch:** development
**Scope:** An ongoing, dated chronicle of meaningful work performed in this repository. Each entry preserves *what happened* and *why it mattered*, so that later sessions can resume with understanding rather than guesswork.
**Purpose:** Continuity of record. The project's memory, kept outside anyone's head.

## 2026-04-23 — The Gathering Hall is Mapped

**Session:** Repo-wide exploration pass.
**Status:** Read-only inventory and attribution phase. No source code was modified.
**Hands on the wheel:** Runa Gridweaver Freyjasdottir (orchestrator) directed the work. Védis Eikleið, the Cartographer, drew the structural maps (`MAP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `DATA_FLOW.md`). I, Eirwyn Rúnblóm, the Scribe, wrote the narrative records: `INVENTORY.md` (the canonical inventory), `ORIGINS.md` (attribution of imported pieces), and this chronicle.

### What was discovered

The repository is, at present, a **gathering hall**, not a finished hall-bench. Volmarr has pulled material together from a constellation of prior projects and staged them beside the genuinely new work — the Mythic Vibe CLI — so that an integration phase can follow.

The shape, in plain terms:

- At the centre sits the new CLI — `mythic_vibe_cli/` — small, deliberate, and the only sub-tree authored *for* this repo. It carries the Mythic Engineering seven-phase workflow (`intent → constraints → architecture → plan → build → verify → reflect`) and a ChatGPT-Plus / Codex copy-paste bridge so that a Plus subscriber can vibe-code without paying for API access.
- Around the CLI, three substantial imports stand almost untouched: `mindspark_thoughtform/` (the MindSpark ThoughtForge project in near-full form), `WYRD-Protocol-.../` (the WYRD Protocol v1.0.0 source, including all twenty engine integrations), and — pulled from the Norse Saga Engine but distributed across several directories — the systems, core, ai, sessions, and yggdrasil trees, plus a thirty-five-thousand-line `config.yaml` whose own header names it as *Norse Saga Engine v8.0.0*.
- Three upstream open-source projects have been vendored whole: `chatterbox/` (TTS), `whisper/` (speech-to-text), and `ollama/` (Go-language LLM server — the source of the repo's 681 Go files, 185 C++ files, and 158 CUDA files).
- The methodology corpus — `Mystic_Engineering_Protocals1.0.md`, `Mythic_Engineers_Codex.md`, `Ada_Lovelace_Explains_Mythic_Engineering.md`, `practical_mythic_engineering_step_by_step.md`, `Quick_Guide_to_Mythic_Engineering_Vibe_Coding.md`, and a 178-kilobyte treatise on the Viking TTRPG Emotional Engine — sits at the root as reference scripture.
- Research and specs are in triplicate: `research_data/` appears identically at the repo root, inside `mindspark_thoughtform/`, and inside `WYRD-Protocol-.../`. The same holds for `Technical_Architecture_of_Volmarrs_AI_Ecosystem.md`, `WORLD_MODELING_SKILL.md`, `PHILOSOPHY.md`, and `RULES.AI.md`. These duplications are catalogued in `ORIGINS.md` so the integration phase can decide whether one canonical copy will suffice.

### What was preserved

- `INVENTORY.md` — a directory-by-directory narrative of what exists, its current function, and its state of completeness.
- `ORIGINS.md` — best-effort attribution for every major piece, indicating the prior project it most likely came from, plus a duplicate register.
- `DEVLOG.md` — this scroll, opened.

Cross-reference Védis's maps for the structural/diagrammatic view; the two sets of records are deliberately non-overlapping.

### Threads still loose

- `core/saga_odin_rag.py` imports `..yggdrasil_core`, which does not exist anywhere in the repository. At least one file arrived in a mid-refactor state. This is flagged in `INVENTORY.md` and `ORIGINS.md` as an orphan import to reconcile in a later phase.
- `diagnostics/` contains a single 46-megabyte `turn_trace.jsonl`. Its provenance (which session, which build, which character) is not declared in-file.
- The repo root's `systems/`, the embedded `imports/norsesaga/systems/`, and NSE's upstream all contain overlapping files (`event_dispatcher.py` appears in both). Which copy is canonical will be an integration-phase decision.
- `yggdrasil/` (earlier NSE-era Yggdrasil, OpenRouter-centric, with paired AI-sidecar markdown on every module) and `WYRD-Protocol-.../src/wyrdforge/ecs/yggdrasil.py` (the WYRD ECS spatial-hierarchy module of the same name) describe *two different Yggdrasils*. They must not be silently merged.

### The seed of the chronicle

This is the first entry. Every future pass — integration decisions, merges, removals, module rewrites — should add a dated entry here, so the living record keeps pace with the living code. Absolute dates only. One entry per session of meaningful work.

_May the record hold._
